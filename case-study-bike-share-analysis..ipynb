The company sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.\n\n**Some interesting Facts:**\n* The bike-share program features over 5800 bicycles and 600 dock stations\n* Most riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options.\n* About 30% use them to commute to work each day, the rest ride for leisure\n* According to Cyclistic financial analyst, members are much more profitable than casual riders\n     \n**Pricing and membership type:**\n\n    Pricing          ----          Customer Type\n*     Single-ride pass      -----       Casual rider\n*     Full-ride pass        -----       Casual rider\n*     Annual membership     -----       Membership\n\n**My Role:** Junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team. \n\n**The business task:**  Convert casual riders into annual members\n\n**Specific business questions:** \n\n*   How do annual member and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\n*   Why should casual riders buy Cyclistic annual membership?\n\n*   How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n**Premise:** The price flexibility model helps the company to attract customers and profits. With annual members, more profitable than casual rides, the director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.\n\n**Specific business questions:** \n* How do annual member and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n* Why should casual riders buy Cyclistic annual membership?\n* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n**Key stakeholders:**\n\n*   Lily Moreno: The director of marketing\n\n*   The Cyclistic executive team and\n\n*   Cyclistic marketing analytics team\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**PHASE 2:**\n\n**PREPARE:**\n\n**KeyTasks:**\n\nThe prepare phase ensures that you have all of the data you need for your analysis and that you have credible, useful data.\n* Collect data and store it appropriately\n* Identify how it’s organized\n* Sort and filter the data\n* Determine the credibility of the data\n\n\n**Data Sources:** the data is located [here]( https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and made available by Motivate International Inc under the [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)\n\n* The data is a public dataset made available by International Inc.\n\n* 12 months csv files organized from 01/2021 to 12/2021\n\n* 13 variables \n\n**Checking for ROCCC**\n\n    R => Reliable: Complete, accurate and not biased\n    \n    O => Original: data is in the original source \n    \n    C => Comprehensive: Yes.
